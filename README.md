This project is part of my effort to improve my skills as a software developer while enjoying the process of building real applications on my own. It’s not based on a step-by-step tutorial but developed entirely independently, inspired by the awesome challenges shared by J.C. on [codingChallanges](https://codingchallenges.fyi)

# SwissView
A Chrome extension that will customise the look and functionality of each new tab you open in Chrome. It’s drawing on inspiration from the popular extension Bonjourr and the more complicated Momentum.

You can find the challange here:
